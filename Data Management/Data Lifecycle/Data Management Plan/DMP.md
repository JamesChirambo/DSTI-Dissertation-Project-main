Data Management Planning:
First part of the lifecycle
Lays down plans for all the rest
What data will I create?
How will I describe them?
How will I store them?
Will I publish and share them? If not, why not?
How will others find them?


A formal document that captures the above
Outlines what you will do with your data during and after you complete your research
Ensures your data are safe for the present and the future
