2. JS approves.
3. 
>> Datasets
1. JC - dataset download limitation due to small storage on PC
2. JS - to follow up on the Cirrus account 
3. JC - has looked at bird species so far. But still looking for Higher resolution image sources for any objects.
4. JS - Get hi-res; reduce hi-res to low-res (a copy) for training and testing; test to generate hi-res image; check how the model/human judge how close the generated image is to the original hi-res.

1.	Project Proposal / Project Idea(s)
2.	Literature Review
> Agenda
1.	Discuss What sort of projects JC is interested in doing and why.
2.	Explaining what the projects are and what it entails and what the next months are going to be about.
> Meeting Notes, Discussions, Issues
>> Project idea
1. 
>> Reading: CNN and GANs
1. JC, Implementation of CNN and GANs available.
2. AP: JC to come up with a project title for the idea of image enlargment using GANs.
3. JS. What would you be testing? How would you do that? given an enlarged small image and a non-enlarged large image, how would you tell which is which?
4. JS. Image quality, will be different (human eye perception). enlarged small image = low-res, non-enlarged large image = high-res
>> Steps (Work done in preparation)
1. **AP**: JC to get a dataset of the desired images - *Research ethics and integrity apply*
2. **AP**: JC to reduce the quality of (some of) the images
3. **AP**: Train an ML model to classify low-res vs hi-res
4. **AP**: Test the accuracy of the trained model.  This is an agent to go against the GAN.


>> Progress..
1. Topic example: Using GANs to Improve Image Quality
2. Could also do futher tests, i.e. using a defusing algorithm rather than a GAN? Because GAN take long to train?
3. **AP**: JS to facilitate setting up of MSc Project account on Cirrus.

> Meeting Notes, Discussions, Issues
>> Literature Reading (JS)
1. JC have read some literature and watched videos of GANs.  
2. JC finds **image enlargment using GANs** an interesting idea.
3. JS - GANs for images seems the best aproach - extensive use so far. Because you're training an adversarial model, you need something that is adversarial against, something like CNN.
4. **AP**: JC to look at CNNs
5. JS - JC is very new to this field: **AP**: *Important* JC to choose materials that are most useful to introduce you (not necessarily scientific papers) i.e. youtube, blog articles; and these are sitable. Read the abstruct and the introduction of the articles at this stage. Read conclusion if it's interesting.
6. JC has identified several other potential areas of research from the scientific literature, but are increadibly mathematical (i.e. improving GANs models); and is concerned feasible/suitable proposal, given the maths knowledge prerequisite for the ML.   
7. JS thinks this not a concern, and used a chess game analogy to demonstrate the simplicity of GANs and to emphasize that these concept can be explained without talking about maths.  However, if maths is the important bit of the report, then focus on the maths.
8. JS - For an MSc, it's OK to do work that has been done before. Unlike PhD, which requires demonstration of novel research, MSc requires demonstration of research.

>> Resource Allocation:
1. As part of the project JC will get an account on Cirrus. GPUs available, with Python, PyTorch and TensorFlow support.

>> Dissertation Deadline:
1. Mid August 2024

>>> Next Meeting: *2023-05-02 15:30*

## Aim (JS)
To get an idea of:
1. What sort of projects I am interested in doing and why.
2. Explaining what the projects are and what it entails and what the next months are going to be about.

## Purpose of the Project Prep (JS)
1. Test out ideas for my project 
2. Make sure I get an understand for how to do that project
3. make sure that I am able to do it
4. Make sure that it is something that will fit nicely in the amount of time I have
5. IMPORTANT: Has to be something that is interesting to ME

> Project Interests
1. (JC) ML but not taken the course.
2. (JS) The course would have been really helpful. Access the content if available. (JC) some content available on https://media.ed.ac.uk/
3. (JS) other tones of material available. i.e. reinforcement learning course (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-)

 >> **Food for though: (JS)**
  1. What about ML is it that you're interested in? Images? raw text files? NLP/ extracting certain words? There are so many flavors of ML.
  2. What sorts of Data sets? (Ethics)
  3. What do you want to do with it? 

> Proposed ML (JS)
- OpenAI Gym: Train an agent to play a game really well.  
   * JS has a couple of board games to work on if JC is interested, esp in train games.  
   * Loads of interesting math that could happen in this
   * There is a place where there is a tone of data that can be collected and train the model
- Image Processing using Convolutional neural network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
   * Looking at dog breeds... pick out different.. and classify them..
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (JC picked this) - Fascinating concept

> ML Projects are difficult (JS)
1. Incredibly mathematical!
2. anything you come up with, probably someone's already done it.
 - How do you make sure that you're doing your own work, rather than just copying someone else's work?
3. Resource allocation
 - a project that's quick enough to train, but you're able to complete it.  
 - i.e. look at a very small bit of NLP/word detection/translation; then be able to focus and get a lot of interesting scientific findings

> Action Points
1. JC to learn and read about it GANs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
2. JC to look at scientific literature (just abstructs) about GANs and aim to understand what people have used it for.
4. JC to identify any interesting ideas and why?
