# 2. Designing and Implementing a GAN-based Approach for Enlarging a Low-Resolution Images

## 1 Introduction

## 2 Background and Literature Review

gan implementations that generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input image
ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN): ESRGAN is specifically designed for single-image super-resolution. It utilizes a GAN architecture to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. ESRGAN has shown impressive results in enhancing the visual quality and details of low-resolution images.

SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN): SRGAN is another GAN-based approach for super-resolution. It uses a GAN architecture along with perceptual loss and adversarial loss to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. SRGAN aims to generate realistic and visually appealing super-resolved images.

SFTGAN (Semi-Supervised Fine-Grained Classification GAN): SFTGAN is a GAN-based model that combines image super-resolution with fine-grained image classification. It generates high-resolution images while preserving the fine-grained details and class-specific information. SFTGAN can be useful in applications where high-resolution images are required for detailed analysis and classification tasks.

## 3 Preliminary Investigations and Findings
## 4 Project Proposal
Designing and Implementing a GAN-based Approach for Enlarging a Low-Resolution Images.

The input image size of recent FCGAN model is same as the generative HR image (128×128). 
Exprole an advanced model design that can directly generate HR image (e.g., 128 × 128) from the small size one (e.g., 32 × 32).
